# Energy Consumption in Scottish Council Areas (2005–2020)

## Introduction

The Scottish Government publishes annual energy consumption data for all 32 council areas in Scotland. This dataset spans the years 2005 to 2020 and includes various energy types—such as electricity, gas, coal, and petroleum products—across multiple consumption sectors including domestic, transport, public sector, and industrial & commercial use.

The dataset includes several energy sources such as:

- **Electricity**
- **Gas**
- **Coal**
- **Manufactured Fuels**
- **Petroleum Products** (e.g., diesel, petrol, heating oil)
- **Bioenergy & Wastes** (where available)

It also categorizes energy consumption by sector, including:

- **Domestic** – energy used in households for heating, lighting, and appliances
- **Agriculture**
- **Rail**
- **Road Transport** – fuel used in road transport and other transportation modes
- **Public Sector** – energy consumed by government and public services
- **Industrial & Commercial** – usage by manufacturing, construction, services, and other businesses


## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and interpret the Scottish Government’s annual energy consumption data from 2005 to 2020 across all 32 council areas in Scotland. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of how energy is used across different regions, energy types, and economic sectors.

Specifically, the project seeks to:

- **Identify trends** in energy consumption over time.
- **Compare consumption patterns** across different council areas.
- **Evaluate sector-specific usage** such as domestic, transport, public sector, and industrial & commercial.
- **Assess the impact of policy changes** or external factors (e.g., economic shifts, climate goals) on energy use.
- **Support climate action planning** by providing data-driven insights to local authorities and policymakers.
- **Monitor progress toward sustainability goals**, including Scotland’s commitment to net-zero carbon emissions.

By achieving these goals, the project contributes to a better-informed energy strategy, encourages energy efficiency, and supports the broader transition to a low-carbon economy in Scotland.

## Aim 
This project aims to uncover meaningful insights into Scotland’s energy usage, sectoral demand, and changes over time. The outcome will support policy recommendations, sustainability planning, and energy efficiency assessments.
